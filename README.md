Machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes based on financial and personal data.

# Loan Approval Prediction Model

📅 **Timeline**: 2022  
🛠️ **Tools Used**: Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  
🏢 **Project Type**: Academic / Data Science

## 📌 Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application would be approved or rejected. The goal was to streamline the loan screening process and improve accuracy in financial decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
Historical loan application data with applicant demographics, credit history, income, and loan amount
Cleaned and preprocessed using Python (pandas, NumPy)
SQL was used to extract and filter raw data into training format

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
Feature engineering for income, credit ratio, and loan amount
Trained logistic regression and random forest classifiers
Evaluated models using precision, recall, and accuracy

## 🎯 Results
Achieved 85%+ accuracy on test set
Reduced manual review time by 50% on 10,000+ applications

## 👩‍💻 My Role
End-to-end pipeline development (data → model → output)
Wrote preprocessing scripts and model training code
Evaluated multiple algorithms and tuned parameters
