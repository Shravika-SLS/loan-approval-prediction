Machine learning model to predict loan approval outcomes based on financial and personal data.

# Loan Approval Prediction Model

📅 **Timeline**: 2022  
🛠️ **Tools Used**: Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  
🏢 **Project Type**: Academic / Data Science

## 📌 Overview
Built a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application would be approved or rejected. The goal was to streamline the loan screening process and improve accuracy in financial decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
-> Historical loan application data with applicant demographics, credit history, income, and loan amount
-> Cleaned and preprocessed using Python (pandas, NumPy)
-> SQL was used to extract and filter raw data into training format

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
-> Feature engineering for income, credit ratio, and loan amount
-> Trained logistic regression and random forest classifiers
-> Evaluated models using precision, recall, and accuracy

## 🎯 Results
-> Achieved 85%+ accuracy on test set
-> Reduced manual review time by 50% on 10,000+ applications

## 👩‍💻 My Role
-> End-to-end pipeline development (data → model → output)
-> Wrote preprocessing scripts and model training code
-> Evaluated multiple algorithms and tuned parameters
